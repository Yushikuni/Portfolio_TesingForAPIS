# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


### Need to finish

Only one thing needs to be finished: content. For content, I need to use APIs just because I am not lazy, but I need to update alone when an internet connection is available.

#### How to build:
REBuild: npm run dev

Right now Itchio api in not working and I work on pictures :D

#### APIs:
- Github
  - Projects
- LinkedIn
  - Title
  - Certificates
  - Work History
  - Profile picture
  - Name
- WordPress
  - Articles
- Itch.io
  - Release projects
